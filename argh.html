<h1>What's it like to be a pirate?</h1>

<p>So, ye have some interest in bein' a part of this 'ere club, do ye?

<h3>The Captain</h3>
<p>The captain is the title with glory. But one does not get to just become Captain, you must be elected democratically. Do you think you have the charisma to do politics on the high seas? If so, give it a go! The Captain is responsible for making decisions that concern the ship. They are also the commander during battle.</p>
<br>

<h3>The Quartermaster</h3>
<p>The Quartermaster is in charge of life aboard the ship. They are in charge of upholding the ship's contract and settling disputes among the crew or between the crew and the captain.
<br>

<h3>Sailing Master</h3>
<p>They didn't have Google Earth in the past, they just had this guy.</p>
<br>

<h3>Boatswain</h3>
<p>Reporting to the Quartermaster, the Boatswain (often called Bosun) is responsible for the supplies abord the ship as well as maintenance.s</p>
<br>

<h3>Surgeon/Carpenter</h3>
<p>Are you an expert at being productive with sharp objects? Do you have a sturdy saw and a sturdier stomach? This may be the job for you!</p>
<br>

<h3>Master Gunner</h3>
<p>Try and name a better combination than gross incompetence and high explosives. I certainly can't. If you feel the same, youll have fun as a Master Gunner.</p>
<br>

<h3>Cook</h3>
<p>Parkhurst Dining Services</p>
<br>

<h3>Mates</h3>
<p>Mates are apprentices to the higer-level roles. They typically replace their bosses should the boss become injured.</p>
<br>

<h3>Able-Bodied Sailors</h3>
<p>Able-Bodied Sailors are any full working members of the crew that don't have a specialty role.</p>
<br>

<h3>Cabin Boy</h3>
<p>You know the bored-looking kids bussing tables at your local diner? Basically that, but on a pirate ship.</p>
