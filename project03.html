 <h2>My Technology Beginnings</h2>
 
 <p> I <b>really</b> enjoy building computers. I built my own for the first time when I was in 8th grade, and I became passionate about the process. I learned a lot from the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LinusTechTips">LinusTechTips</a> , and I continue to be an avid viewer today. To quench my thirst for knowlege about the subject, I began accumulating old, sometimes broken computers with the intent of tearing them apart and putting them back together and learning all I can from them.  </p>
 
 <h2>Applying Skills</h2>

 <p> After some time, I felt confident enough in my skills to apply them. I began building gaming computers for my friends, so that they could play games at a higher visual fidelity, and run more complicated games in the first place. To help me with the process of compatibility checking components, I utilized the website <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPicker</a> , as it allows for very easy sharing of complete parts lists. <i>This was helpful in my workflow,</i> because I found that the easiest way to build computers for my friends was to have them purchase the parts directly for me to assemble.  </p>
